    "In this solution I used the following data structures and functions:\n",
    "- <strong>solution</strong> is a numpy matrix where each row represents a knapsack. There actually is one more row than the number of kanpsacks and it represents the left-out items. So the row 0 contains the items which have not been taken. At first each item is left out, I also tried to start with a randomized solution but it could just not converge.\n",
    "- <strong>tweak</strong> this time I do not swap a random number of random items, but a number which decreases with time. This way I can at first swap more items (exploration) and avoid getting stuck in a local maximum, then I start changing less items (exploitation) to find the best solution. \n",
